# Welcome to the Rectifier System
This is a GUI aimed at rectifying images before being processed from the Detector System.
Dealing with hundreds of images can be computationally expensive and this interface will take care of the rectification process. After the images are transformed will be saved and passed to the Detection System. 
The goal of this GUI is to make detection and training of specific blood cells easier for the user/doctor in order to categorize images captured. Those images will then be passed to the database manager system where will be analyzed and stored.
